# Tensorflow Practice

I will be practicing Tensorflow using MNIST dataset.Mainly about simple low level Tensorflow 
API, as for high level API, such as Pretty Tensor, tf.layers, or Dataset and Estimator, etc., I
won't be using them since some of them are deprecated, some of them are not that easy to use.
Keras might be the standard API for Tensorflow, well developed and easy to use, so I recommand
to use Keras as Tensorflow's high level API

## Requirement

- Tensorflow 1.4
- Python 3.5

## Practice

- Simple Linear Model (achieve 91% accuracy on test dataset)
- Convolutional Neural Network (achieve 95.3% max)
- Keras API Practice (achieve 98% accuracy)


## Edit
This repo is inspired by [Hvass-Labs/TensorFlow-Tutorials](https://github.com/Hvass-Labs/TensorFlow-Tutorials), hats off to him.
I was going to use jupyter notebook to write the tutorial, but jupyter can't use VIM(at least I
dont not know how), So I would write this in the plain python file
