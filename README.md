# Tensorflow Practice

I will be practicing Tensorflow using MNIST dataset.Mainly about simple low level Tensorflow 
API, as for high level API, such as Pretty Tensor, tf.layers, or Dataset and Estimator, etc., I
won't be using them since some of them are deprecated, some of them are not that easy to use.
Keras might be the standard API for Tensorflow, well developed and easy to use, so I recommand
to use Keras as Tensorflow's high level API

## Requirement

Tensorflow 1.4
